I'm Shashank Siripragada. I'm a Graduate student at Northeastern Univeristy, Boston. 

I'm working as a Research Fellow at [CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) where I am advised by [Dr. C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) and [Dr. Vinay P. Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io/). At CVIT, I'm involved in ongoing efforts in improving Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT) systems and in curating parallel corpora to aid MNMT progress for low-resourced Indian languages. More details about the project [here](http://preon.iiit.ac.in/~jerin/bhasha/).

Prior to joining CVIT as a Research Fellow, I worked at Primera as a Data Scientist where I built predictive models for early detection and intervention in case of patients at risk of certain diseases or adverse clinical outcomes using patient Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Beyond modelling, I also built comprehensive dashboards to track Insurance Claims and Denials at enterprise level.

I completed my Bachelor's Degree in 2017 from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/).
